# Challenge 1: Square Numbers and Return Their Sum

"""
    Problem statement: Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method. All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. This problem can be broken down into two tasks:

    Task 1: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z.

    Task 2: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum.
