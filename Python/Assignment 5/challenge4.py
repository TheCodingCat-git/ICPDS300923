# Challenge 4: Implement a Banking Account

"""
    Problem statement

    Implement the basic structure of a parent class, Account, and a child class, SavingsAccount.

    Task 1

    ðŸ‘‰ Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0.

    Account has the following properties:

        â€¢ title
        â€¢ Balance
    SavingsAccount has the following properties:

        â€¢ interestRate
    Task 2

    Create an initializer for Account class. The order of parameters should be the following, where Ashish is the title, and 5000 is the account balance:

    Account("Ashish", 5000)

    Task 3

    Implement properties as instance variables, and set them to None or 0.

    Create an initializer for the SavingsAccount class using the initializer of the Account class in the order below:

    Account("Ashish", 5000, 5)

    Here, Ashish is the title and 5000 is the balance and 5 is the interestRate.

    Coding exercise

    class Account:
